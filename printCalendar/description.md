Write a Java program that calculates the first day of the years from 2021 to 2024 and then generates the January calendar for each of these years. Specifically, determine the weekday on which January starts for each year, following the rule that the starting day of the week moves forward by one day each subsequent year, regardless of whether it's a leap year or not. For instance, if January 1st is on a Tuesday in one year, then January 1st of the following year will fall on a Wednesday.

This logic is applied across the years 2021 to 2024, meaning:

The day of the week for January 1st increases by one for each subsequent year.
Create a visual representation of the January calendars for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

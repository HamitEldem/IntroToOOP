Create a Java program that displays two charts:

1. One chart lists the Fahrenheit equivalents for Celsius temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 degrees, with increments of 5 degrees.
2. The second chart presents the Celsius equivalents for Fahrenheit temperatures, starting from 32 to 140 degrees, with increments of 18 degrees.
<hr>
The program should include the following methods: <br>
- `convertToCelsius`: This method takes a Fahrenheit temperature as a parameter and returns its equivalent in Celsius. <br>
- `convertToFahrenheit`: This method takes a Celsius temperature as a parameter and returns its equivalent in Fahrenheit. <br>
